    <h1>Hello World Program in Letlang</h1>
    <p>So, you downloaded LetLang's source for this.. Well done.
      Now, here's the syntax.
      1 = Exit and print the output
      2 = Add 1 to value
      3 = Subtract 1 from value
      4 = Loop x times and add 1 to value each time (x being the next number, cancels out all effects, like the 1 exit)
      5 = Print "Hello, world!"
      6 = Value Squared
      To make a simple hello world, it's just the string "51". The end! See the next part which im making soon
